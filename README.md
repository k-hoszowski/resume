# Software Engineer / Open to Work
Support Engineer with a sharp analytical mind, deep empathy for clients, and a strong commitment to excellence. In my current L2 role supporting Db2 systems, I’ve consistently demonstrated the ability to absorb complex technical concepts quickly and retain them over time, resolve customer issues holistically, and communicate clearly across technical and non-technical audiences.

I'm skilled at dynamically managing priorities from critical incidents to long-term improvements. I take full ownership of my responsibilities, maintain high standards in communication and data safety, and actively use tools like shell scripting, documentation analysis, and AI to automate, investigate, and innovate within organizational bounds.

My work is driven by customer success and the reliability of the systems I support. I deliver not just solutions to problems—but thoughtful, tested improvements that contribute to shared knowledge and better practices. See more in **_Resume.pdf_** .
